I am currently a seismology Ph.D. student in the Department of [Earth and Space Sciences (ESS)](https://ess.washington.edu) at University of Washington, supervised by Dr. Marine Denolle. I am also a duty seismologist in the [Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN)](https://pnsn.org). Before joining UW in 2021, I earned a B.Sc in Geophysics from Jilin University in December 2020.

The overall goal of my research is to advance our knowledge of monitoring earthquakes and near-surface structure by leveraging heterogeneous datasets from seismic stations and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). A core focus of my research is the development of cutting-edge tools that empower Cloud computing for massive seismic data storing and processing. My recent study involves time-lapse imaging of shallow subsurface using a dark fiber in the northern Seattle region.
