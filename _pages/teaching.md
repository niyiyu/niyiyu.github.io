### ESS 314: Geophysics (Fall 2023)
*Undergraduate course, Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington*

This is an undergraduate-level course taught by Prof. [Marine Denolle](https://ess.uw.edu/people/marine-denolle/). We introduce theories underlying geophysical phenomena including seismic wave generation and propagation, the Earthâ€™s magnetic, gravity, and electrical fields, heat and heat flow, buoyancy and density of Earth materials, plate tectonics on the Earth. As the TA, I was responsible for leading the lab, grading homeworks, and holding office hours. I redesigned the lab fully into open-source Python softwares for data modeling ([seismic](https://pyrocko.org), [gravity and magnetic](https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica/dev/)). I also made the lab integrated with the auto-grader through GradeScope using [otter-grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).

The lab material is available at [https://github.com/UW-geophysics-edu/ESS314-fall23](https://github.com/UW-geophysics-edu/ESS314-fall23). The auto-grader source file will be available upon request.
